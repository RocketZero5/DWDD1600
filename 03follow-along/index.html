            <p>
                When in the course of human events, it <strong>becomes necessary</strong>
                for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, 
                and to assume amoung the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station 
                to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
                to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel 
                them to the separation.
            </p>
