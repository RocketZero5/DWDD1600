                Our Story
            </h1>

            <p>
                This was a bakery founded by a WW1 veteren who decided that war is for nerds and that bread making was the way to go. <br> <br>
                This led to him creating a family run business, it did close during the depression because it was hard but has been running ever sence them. <br> <br>
                The Putin family helped in the WW2 effort by sending the famous "Workers Bread" to the frontline of the Soviet Union. <br> <br>
                This did lead to the Bakery being investedaged for communist sentements where the original family owners were exicutied and burned at the stake as if it was still 1692. <br> <br>
                That led to our family - the angelo's - stealing the property and creating our own bakery in its place. <br> <br>
                This is because we are superiar to the reds and will prove that our loyalty to capitalism and democracy <br> <br>
                Our Glorious Founder - Michal Angelo
